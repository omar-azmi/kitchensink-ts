/** a stopwatch class that provides convince methods for timing.
 * this module exports a global {@link defaultStopwatch} available to all importing scripts,
 * which is beneficial if you want to use a single stop watch across many modules,
 * otherwise, if you want a dedicated stopwatch, you can create a new instance of this class.
 *
 * this stopwatch operates on the principals of a stack data-structure:
 * that is, you can `push`, `pop`, and `seek` the time.
 * the `Delta` methods provide the *elapsed* time since the last `push`.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { assertGreater, assertLess, assertThrows } from "jsr:@std/assert"
 *
 * const stop_watch = new Stopwatch("perf")
 * stop_watch.push()
 * const
 * 	resolved_value: "hello" = await (new Promise((resolve) => {
 * 		setTimeout(() => { resolve("hello") }, 300)
 * 	})),
 * 	delta_time = stop_watch.popDelta(),
 * 	log = `execution time: ${delta_time} ms`
 * assertGreater(delta_time, 290) // completing the promise should take more than `290` milliseconds
 * assertLess(delta_time, 400) // completing the promise should take less than `400` milliseconds
 * // the stack of `stop_watch` is empty now, so trying to `popDelta` will throw an error (intentional by design)
 * assertThrows(() => stop_watch.popDelta())
 * ```
